### Project N-1: Alpha Blending
This project demonstrates the use of alpha blending to handle transparency in scenes where multiple objects overlap. The blending is calculated based on alpha values, providing realistic visual effects.

### Project N-2: Transformations
In this project, you will see various transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling applied to objects. These transformations are combined to modify objects in both 2D and 3D spaces.

### Project N-3: Triangular Meshes
This project showcases the implementation of triangular meshes. It focuses on the use of triangles to represent complex 3D objects, with attention to surface detail and performance optimization.

### Project N-4: Shading
Explore the fundamentals of shading models, including Phong and Gouraud shading, to simulate how light interacts with surfaces. This project enhances object realism by adjusting how light and shadows are rendered.

### Project N-5: Ray Tracing
Ray tracing is a rendering technique that simulates light paths to create high-quality images. This project demonstrates basic ray tracing principles, handling reflection, refraction, and shadows to create photorealistic images.

### Project N-6: Animations
In this project, various animation techniques are applied to create smooth movements in graphics. Keyframing, interpolation, and timing functions are used to animate objects in real time.
###Usage
Each project is self-contained and can be run independently. Refer to the individual project folders for more detailed instructions.
